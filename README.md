# Northcoders House of Games API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

# Enviroment Variables

To connect the two databases please add a .env.test and a .env.development file which contain PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
